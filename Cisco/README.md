# Templates for Zabbix used for Cisco devices

Some templates based on the default templates included in Zabbix installation for Cisco devices.

On all these templates:

- No graph is present. I prefer to use grafana to display the graph instead of Zabbix.

- You can found specific installations in the subdirectory for
 - Cisco COS
 - Cisco Interfaces

- Many templates with the SNMPv2 and SNMPv3 (authNoPriv) configuration
